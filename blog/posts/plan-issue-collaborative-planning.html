        <h1>/plan-issue: Collaborative Planning with AI</h1>

        <p>This is Part 2 of my series on AI-assisted development. <a href="/blog/posts/ai-assisted-development-loop-not-chat.html">Part 1</a> covers the overall workflow loop.</p>

        <p>I kept running into the same problem: the AI would implement something, and it wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted. Not because the AI was bad at coding, but because I was bad at specifying. Vague instructions produce vague implementations.</p>

        <p>So I started planning separately from implementing. <code>/plan-issue</code> is a Claude Code slash command that takes a rough Linear issue and turns it into a detailed spec through conversation. The AI explores the codebase, I make decisions. No code gets written. The output is a Linear issue with enough detail that <code>/work-issue</code> can implement it later without needing me in the room.</p>

        <h2>How I structured the planning phase</h2>

        <p>The command is a markdown prompt in <code>.claude/commands/plan-issue.md</code>. I iterated on this a lot before landing on something that worked. The key insight was that planning needs a rigid structure &mdash; otherwise I&rsquo;d skip steps and end up with vague specs anyway. Here&rsquo;s what the protocol looks like now and why each piece matters.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Fetch the issue</h3>

<pre><code class="language-bash">/plan-issue                    # Auto-pick oldest Backlog issue
/plan-issue --id=BROT-42       # Plan a specific issue
</code></pre>

        <p>The AI connects to Linear via MCP, grabs the issue, and shows me what we&rsquo;re working with &mdash; title, priority, existing description (often sparse or empty).</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Claim it</h3>

        <p>The issue moves to <strong>In Progress</strong> immediately. This prevents another run (or another developer) from picking the same issue. Simple but important when you&rsquo;re batching work.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Gather context</h3>

        <p>The AI reads:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Linear data</strong> &mdash; comments, parent issues, sub-issues, related issues</li>
          <li><strong>Architecture docs</strong> from <code>docs/</code> &mdash; platform overview, tech stack, data model (I mentioned this in Part 1 &mdash; the <code>docs/</code> folder gives the AI persistent project context)</li>
          <li><strong>Relevant code</strong> &mdash; existing handlers, components, DB queries in the area the issue touches</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It puts together what exists, what needs to change, and what could go wrong. This is stuff I&rsquo;d otherwise do by hand &mdash; grepping through files, reading handlers, checking the schema.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Present analysis</h3>

        <p>The AI presents its findings in a structured format:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Analysis: Add review calendar notifications

### What exists today
- Review calendar at /calendar shows 12-month view
- Reviews table has due dates but no notification system
- Email infrastructure exists (used for invitations)

### Scope assessment
- **Size:** Medium
- **Areas affected:** Backend (notifications), Frontend (calendar UI), Database (notification preferences)
- **Key files:** internal/api/reviews.go, web/src/pages/Calendar.tsx, db/queries/notifications.sql

### Proposed approach
- Add notification_preferences table with per-user settings
- Cron job checks for upcoming review deadlines daily
- Send email + in-app notification 3 days before due date

### Open questions
1. Should notifications be per-review or per-user global setting?
2. What's the notification window — 3 days? 7 days? Configurable?
3. Should we notify the reviewer, the SOP author, or both?

### Risks / Dependencies
- Email sending is async; need to handle failures gracefully
- Calendar UI currently has no notification indicators
</code></pre>

        <p><strong>This is where I do my actual work.</strong> I answer the open questions, push back on scope, redirect the approach. The AI is doing research; I&rsquo;m making product decisions.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Split if needed</h3>

        <p>The AI assesses whether the issue should be broken into subtasks. The heuristic is practical:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Touches 3+ distinct areas? Split.</li>
          <li>Would take more than ~2 hours of autonomous work? Split.</li>
          <li>Has independent pieces that could be parallelized? Split.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If splitting is warranted, it proposes a breakdown:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Suggested subtask breakdown

1. **Add notification preferences table** — Migration + sqlc queries + API endpoint
2. **Build notification engine** — Cron job, email sending, in-app notifications
3. **Calendar UI notifications** — Indicators on calendar, notification preferences page

Each subtask will be independently implementable by /work-issue.
</code></pre>

        <p>I approve, reject, or modify the breakdown. Nothing gets created until I say so.</p>

        <h3>Step 6: Write the refined spec</h3>

        <p>The AI writes a complete description using a consistent template:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Summary
Add notification system for upcoming review deadlines.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Users can set notification preferences (email, in-app, both, none)
- [ ] System checks for reviews due within 3 days, daily at 8am
- [ ] Reviewers receive email notification with review link
- [ ] Calendar page shows notification indicator on upcoming reviews
- [ ] Notification preferences accessible from user profile

## Technical approach
- **Backend:** New notification_preferences table, cron job in cmd/server/
- **Frontend:** NotificationBadge component on Calendar, preferences in profile
- **Database:** migration 000042_add_notification_preferences.up.sql

## Files likely affected
- `internal/api/notifications.go` — New handler
- `db/queries/notifications.sql` — New queries
- `web/src/pages/Calendar.tsx` — Add notification indicators
- `web/src/components/NotificationPreferences.tsx` — New component

## Testing strategy
- Backend: unit tests for cron job logic, handler tests for preferences API
- Frontend: Vitest tests for NotificationBadge and preferences form

## Out of scope
- SMS notifications
- Custom notification schedules per review
- Notification history/log page
</code></pre>

        <p>I review this final spec. If it looks good, I approve.</p>

        <h3>Step 7: Update Linear</h3>

        <p>The AI updates Linear &mdash; writes the refined description, creates subtasks if splitting was approved, moves things to <strong>Todo</strong>. Each subtask gets its own complete spec.</p>

        <p>The parent issue stays <strong>In Progress</strong> if it was split (it auto-completes when all subtasks finish). Individual subtasks go to <strong>Todo</strong>, which is the <code>/work-issue</code> pickup queue.</p>

        <h3>Step 8: Update docs (optional)</h3>

        <p>If the planned work would change the architecture, data model, or API surface, the AI asks if I want to update the relevant files in <code>docs/</code>. I usually say yes &mdash; it&rsquo;s a small overhead that keeps future runs accurate. The AI drafts the doc update, I review it, and it gets applied alongside moving the issue to Todo.</p>

        <h2>The lesson: planning is where the real work happens</h2>

        <p>I almost didn&rsquo;t build this phase. It seemed like unnecessary overhead &mdash; why not just let the AI start coding? Here&rsquo;s what changed my mind:</p>

        <p><strong>It catches scope issues before code exists.</strong> The worst time to discover an issue is too big is after you&rsquo;ve written half of it. Planning forces the &ldquo;this needs splitting&rdquo; conversation up front, when it&rsquo;s free.</p>

        <p><strong>It creates a paper trail.</strong> Every planned issue has acceptance criteria, technical approach, file paths, and testing strategy. When <code>/work-issue</code> picks it up weeks later, the context is right there. When I review the commit, I can check it against the spec.</p>

        <p><strong>It stops the AI from improvising.</strong> Without a spec, the AI will make product decisions for you. It&rsquo;ll add features you didn&rsquo;t ask for, pick approaches you wouldn&rsquo;t choose, skip edge cases you care about. Planning is where I write down what I want so the AI doesn&rsquo;t have to guess later.</p>

        <p><strong>It&rsquo;s faster than it sounds.</strong> A planning session takes 5-10 minutes. I spend my time on the interesting parts &mdash; making decisions, answering questions, deciding what&rsquo;s in and what&rsquo;s out.</p>

        <h2>Mistakes I made and what I&rsquo;d do differently</h2>

        <p><strong>Start from Backlog, not from your head.</strong> Keep your ideas in Linear&rsquo;s Backlog. Let <code>/plan-issue</code> pull from there. This prevents the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just quickly add this&rdquo; temptation that leads to unplanned scope.</p>

        <p><strong>Always wait for the open questions.</strong> Don&rsquo;t rush past Step 4. The AI&rsquo;s questions often reveal things I hadn&rsquo;t considered. &ldquo;Should this be per-review or per-user?&rdquo; is a product decision that changes the implementation significantly.</p>

        <p><strong>Split aggressively.</strong> Small, focused issues lead to better autonomous implementation. If an issue touches backend, frontend, and database, that&rsquo;s three subtasks. Each one fits in a single context window.</p>

        <p><strong>The &ldquo;Out of scope&rdquo; section matters more than you&rsquo;d think.</strong> Listing what&rsquo;s NOT included keeps the AI (and me) focused. Without it, <code>/work-issue</code> will sometimes add &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; extras that weren&rsquo;t asked for.</p>
